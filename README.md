# ADVERSARY EMULATION MATRIX by Joas

## What is?

### Adversary emulation is a type of red team engagement that mimics a known threat to an organization by blending in threat intelligence to define what actions and behaviors the red team uses. This is what makes adversary emulation different from penetration testing and other forms of red teaming. Adversary emulators construct a scenario to test certain aspects of an adversary’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). The red team then follows the scenario while operating on a target network in order to test how defenses might fare against the emulated adversary.

### Capabilities

- PERSISTENT RED TEAM OPERATIONS™
- Our team has the capabilities and experience to run long-term persistent style Red Team engagements spanning up to 6 months in length. This capability is rarely found in our industry and pushes some companies boundaries to produce actual threat and adversary replication.
- STRATEGIC ENGAGEMENT PLANNING
- Whether you want a Black Box or Purple Team style engagement, our seasoned Red Team Operators and Management team can help you design and deliver your organization the ideal test. At Obscurity Labs, we understand that it’s about more than just breaking defensives. It’s about helping identify security control and operational gaps that will prevent you from the next breach.
- WHITE CELL COLLABORATION
- Communication is critical to the success of Red Team operations. We take this real-time communication aspect very seriously and provide direct access to Obscurity Labs resources for deconfliction and strategic and tactical decision processes. Our goal is to ensure our customer has the proper channels for escalation and clear guidelines in place.
- ENVIRONMENT STRENGTH OBSERVATIONS
- During the assessment, the Red Ream often encounters security controls that prevent or forces the team to adapt to the environment. These strengths should be noted and lauded. An organization that understands its strengths will have a more significant impact on the overall security of the network. Our team always captures these for future reporting so your security team has the best data on which tools and processes had a high rate of success.
- GAP & RISK ANALYSIS
- During Red Team operations, our team will become extremely familiar with your environment, key cyber terrain, and business unit operations. Our team does this to ensure we can provide unbiased risk and gap based analysis of our findings. We provide key finding details and detection recommendations as part of our deliverables.
- EXECUTIVE OUT-BRIEF SUPPORT
- One of the overlooked components of offensive engagements is providing executive leadership and stakeholders vulnerabilities, metrics, and outcomes during the reporting stage. Obscurity Labs provides on-site or virtual out-briefs to executive leadership tailored to the business unit’s requirements. We use this time to ensure the narrative of the test outcomes are properly received and understood.
- CUSTOM ROE
- Our service adapts to most of today’s threats and can successfully provide you with real-world emulation of those threats. With that comes extensive paper-work! We make it easy by filling out a form to which we provide a custom ROE based on the on-boarding and scoping process, which ensures we protect you from unnecessary actions that can cause impact to your business’s operations. We provide descriptions and expert guidance when planning your next Red Team!
- DOCUMENTATION & REPORTING
- We provide custom-tailored reporting in the format you prefer.
- ON-TAP SECURITY CONSULTING™
- When you enroll in an Adversary Emulation Engagement™ with our team you gain exclusive access to our On-tap Security Consulting team™. This lets you know we stick with you the entire year, summarize, perform a quick analysis of duplicates. Ask our team about any security concerns, implementation, or ways to improve. We are here to help you! We are more than a pentest company!
